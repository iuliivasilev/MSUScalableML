```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Generate Data**: Use the `data_generator.py` to create a large dataset.
2. **Load Data**: Utilize the `data_loader.py` to fetch data in batches.
3. **Train Model**: Run the `main.py` file to start the training process of the linear regression model.

## Running the Project

To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:

```
python src/main.py
```

This will initialize the data generation, loading, and model training processes.
